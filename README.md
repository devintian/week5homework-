# week5homework-

This homework is basically build a calendar to show the task from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.

It can also dispaly the current date and time.

Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.


Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.


Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.
